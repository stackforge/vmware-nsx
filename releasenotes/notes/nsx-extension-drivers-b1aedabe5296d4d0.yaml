    We have added a new configuration variable that will enable us to
    enable existing extensions. The new configuration variable is
    ``nsx_extension_drivers``. This is in the default section.
    This is a list of extansion names. The code for the drivers
    must be in the directory vmware_nsx.extension_drivers.
