features:
  - The NSX-v3 plugin supports DHCP relay service per network
    availability zones. When a router interface port is created,
    the relay service will be added to it.
    DHCP traffic on the subnet will go through the DHCP server
    configured in the dhcp relay service on the NSX, if it is
    connected to the router.
