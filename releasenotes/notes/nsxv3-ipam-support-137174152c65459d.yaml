  - The NSX-v3 plugin can use the platform IPAM for ip allocations for all
    network types.
    In order to use this feature, the ipam_driver in the neutron.conf file
    should be set to vmware_nsxv3_ipam.
    Currently the plugin does not support allocating a specific address
    from the pool depending on the NSX version.
